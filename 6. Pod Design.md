# Understanding Labels
- Kubernetes allows the assigning of key-value pairs called labels to objects for later use
- Maximum label length is 63 characters
- Common practise to assign one or many labels to an object at creation time
## Declaring Labels
- Can be declared imperatively with `run` command or `declaritively` in the `metadata.labels` section in the YAML manifest
- `--labels` or `-l` defines a comma-separated list of labels when creating a pod
```sh
kubectl run labeled-pod --image=nginx \
  --restart=Never --labels=tier=backend,env=dev
```
- Assigning labels to Kubernetes objects by editing the manifest requires a change to the `metadata` section
```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: labeled-pod
  labels:
    env: dev
    tier: backend
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx
```
## Inspecting Labels
- Common way to inspect labels via the `describe` or `get` commands
- Can use the `--show-labels` command line option to display attached labels
## Modifying Labels for a Live Object
- At any given time possible to add/remove/modify a label from an existing Kubernetes object
- Can use the following commands
	- `kubectl label pod <pod-name> <label-to-add>`
	- Editing `metadata.labels` within the YAML file
## Using Label Selectors
- Labels are meaningful when utilised with the selection feature
- A label selector uses a set of criteria to query for Kubernetes objects
### Label Selection from the command line
- Select objects by label using the `--selector` operation, or `-l` for short
- Objects can be filtered by a/an -
	- Equality-based requirement
		- Use operators `=`, `==`, `!=`, in conjunction with operators such as `AND`. **CAN NOT USE `OR`*
		- Typical expression may be like "Select all Pods with the label assignment `env=prod`"
	- Set-based requirement
		- Filter objects based on a set of values using `in`, `notin`, `exists`. `in` and `notin` work based on `OR` boolean.
		- Typical expression may be like "Select all Pods with the label key `env` and the value `prod` or `dev`"
### Label Selection in a Manifest
- Label selection in a manifest is based on the API version of the Kubernetes resource and may differ between different types
``` yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: frontend-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
```
- In the above YAML, network policy is applied only to those with the equality-based requirement `tier=frontend`
# Understanding Annotations
- Declared similarly to labels, represent key-value pairs for providing description metadata
- Cannot be used for querying or selecting objects
## Declaring Annotations
- `kubectl run` does not provide a command-line option for defining annotations unlike labels
- Must be initilised by the `metadata.annotation` within the YAML manifest
``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: annotated-pod
  annotations:
    commit: 866a8dc
    author: 'Benjamin Muschko'
    branch: 'bm/bugfix'
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx
```
## Inspecting Annotations
- similar to labels can use the `describe` or `get` commands
## Modifying Annotations for a Live Object
- `annotate` command is the counterpart for the `labels` command
- Can also edit the YAML manifest and `apply` the change
# Understanding Deployments
- Deployments are a Kubernetes primitive that uses labels as a foundational concept
- Can specify number of Pods running the application with the exact same setup
	- Determine number of replicas
- Ensure that failing Pods are restarted to match desired state
- Utilise the `ReplicaSet` primitive
	- Sole purpose to replicate a guaranteed number of Pods with the same configuration
## Creating Deployments
- Can be created imperatively using `create deployment`
	- `kubectl create deployment my-deploy --image=nginx:1.14.2`
- Or declaritively using the YAML manifest
	- Below - 1 replica matching on the label `app=my-deploy` under the `template` section
```YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deploy
  labels:
    app: my-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-deploy
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-deploy
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
```
## Listing Deployments
- `kubectl get deployments` allows you to list the current deployments for the environment
- `kubectl get replicasets` allows you to list the current replicasets for the environment
## Rendering Deployment Details
- Can inspect details using the `describe` command
## Rolling Out a New Version
- By default, a Deployment rolls out a new container image using a zero-downtime strategy by updating Pods one by one
- Every Deployment keeps a record of rollout history
	- A new version of a rollout is called a revision
	- Can retrieve detailed information of `rollout history` by providing the revision number using the `--revision` command line option
- Rolling update strategy ensures the application is always available to end users
- Can change update strategy by configuring the attribute `strategy.type`
## Rolling Back to a Previous Version
- `rollout` command can roll back to an earlier version
	- `kubectl rollout undo deployment my-deploy --to-revision=1`
- Looking at rollout history, now revision 3 exists. Following the same deployment strategy of a rolling update.
## Manually Scaling a Deployment
- Utilise the `scale` command
	- `kubectl scale deployment my-deploy --replicas=5`
- Changing the value of the `replicas` attribute for the live object and applying it
- A Deployment records scaling activities in its events which can be viewed using `describe deployment` command
## Autoscaling a Deployment
- Two autoscalers can be configured for Deployments
	- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
		- Standard feature of Kubernetes
		- relevant for CKAD exam
	- Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)
		- Suppported by cloud provider or installed manually
- Both utilise the metrics server
### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
- A deployment can be autoscaled using the `autoscale deployment` command
	- `kubectl autoscale deployment my-deploy --cpu-percent=70 --min=2 --max=8`
