# Understanding Health Probing
- Health Probing automates the detection and correction of issues regarding the Pod/Container
- You can configure a container to execute a periodic mini-process that checks for certain conditions
	- Readiness Probe
		- Checks if the application is ready to serve incoming traffic requests
	- Liveness Probe
		- Periodically checks for the applications responsiveness - Kubernetes automatically restarts the pod if the application is in an unhealthy state
	- Startup Probe
		- Kills the container if the application could not start within the set time frame
- Each probe offers 3 distinct methods to verify the health of the container, can define one or multiple of the available health verification methods

| Method                | Option         | Description                                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Custom Command        | `exec.command` | Executes a command inside of the container and checks for its exit-code                    |
| HTTP GET request      | `httpGet`      | Sends a GET request to an endpoint, ranges 200-399 indicates success                       |
| TCP Socket Connection | `tcpSocket`    | Tries to open a TCP socket connection to a port, successful if a connection is established |
- Probes offer a set of attributes that can further configure runtime behaviour 

| Attribute             | Default Value | Description                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `initialDelaySeconds` | 0             | Delay in seconds until first check is executed                 |
| `periodSeconds`       | 10            | Interval for executing a check                                 |
| `timeoutSeconds`      | 1             | Maximum number of seconds until check operation times out      |
| `successThreshold`    | 1             | Number of successful attempts by probe to be deemed successful |
| `failureThreshold`    | 3             | Number of failed attempts by probe to be deemed a failure      |
- Extra information can be found in the `kubectl describe pod <pod>` information
## Readiness probe
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: readiness-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: bmuschko/nodejs-hello-world:1.0.0
    name: hello-world
    ports:
    - name: nodejs-port
      containerPort: 3000
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: nodejs-port
    initialDelaySeconds: 2
    periodSeconds: 8
```
- The YAML manifest has defined a readiness probe for the application
	- Executes the first check after 2 seconds and repeats every 8 seconds after. Other attributes use the default values

## Liveness Probe
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: liveness-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: busybox
    name: app
    args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - 'while true; do touch /tmp/heartbeat.txt; sleep 5; done;'
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
        - test `find /tmp/heartbeat.txt -mmin -1`
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 30
```
- The YAML manifest has defined a liveness probe for the application
	- Expects a specific `heartbeat` file to be updated in the last minute

## Startup Probe
``` YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: startup-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: httpd:2.4.46
    name: http-server
    startupProbe:
      tcpSocket:
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 3
      periodSeconds: 15
```
- The YAML manifest has defined a startup probe for the application
	- Probes port 80 to determine if the Pod has started up

# Debugging in Kubernetes
## Troubleshooting Pods
### Retrieving high-level information
- Information can be retrieved via the following commands
	- `kubectl get pods`
	- `kubectl get all`
- Some common Pod errors are

| Status                               | Root Cause                                                   | Potential Fix                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ImagePullBackOff` or `ErrImagePull` | Image could not be pulled from the registry                  | Check image name, image name exists in registry, network , etc. |
| `CrashLoopBackOff`                   | Application or command run in container crashes              | Check command excuted in container                              |
| `CreateContainerConfigError`         | ConfigMap or Secret referenced by container can not be found | Check correct names of configuration                            |
### Inspecting Events
- Possible to have an error without it an error status occurring - indicating a possible configuration issue
- Look at the pod and its events using `kubectl describe pod <pod>` or events in general using `kubectl get events`
### Inspecting Logs
- `kubectl logs <pod> /-c <container>` allows the investigation of the logs of a Pod/Container
	- Can use the `--previous` flag to get the logs from the previous instance of the container
### Opening an Interactive Shell
- `kubectl exec` allows you to investigate the container that is having issues interactively
### Using an Ephemeral Container
Kubernetes 1.18 introduced a new `debug` command that can add an ephemeral container to a running Pod for debugging purposes. The following command adds the ephemeral container running the image `busybox` to the Pod named `minimal-pod` and opens an interactive shell for it:
``` sh
kubectl alpha debug -it minimal-pod --image=busybox
```
### Troubleshooting Services
- Ensure that the label selector matches with the assinged labels of the Pods
- Query the endpoints of the Service instance

# Monitoring
- The metric server, is a cluster-wide aggregator of resource usage data
- Can grab metrics via the `kubectl top <object>` command
	- `kubectl top nodes`
	- `kubectl top pod frontend`

# Sample Exercises
1. Define a new Pod named `web-server` with the image `nginx` in a YAML manifest. Expose the container port 80. Do not create the Pod yet.
```sh
kubectl run web-server --image=nginx --port=80 -o yaml --dry-run=client > web-server.yaml
```
2. For the container, declare a startup probe of type `httpGet`. Verify that the root context endpoint can be called. Use the default configuration for the probe.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: web-server
  name: web-server
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: web-server
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    resources: {}
    startupProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}

```
3. For the container, declare a readiness probe of type `httpGet`. Verify that the root context endpoint can be called. Wait five seconds before checking for the first time.
``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: web-server
  name: web-server
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: web-server
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    resources: {}
    startupProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path : /
        port: 80
      initalDelaySeconds: 5
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```
4. For the container, declare a liveness probe of type `httpGet`. Verify that the root context endpoint can be called. Wait 10 seconds before checking for the first time. The probe should run the check every 30 seconds.
``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: web-server
  name: web-server
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: web-server
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    resources: {}
    startupProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path : /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 10
      periodSeconds: 30
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```
5. Create the Pod and follow the lifecycle phases of the Pod during the process.
```sh
kubectl apply -f web-server
kubectl get pods web-server --watch
```
6. Inspect the runtime details of the probes of the Pod.
```sh
kubectl describe pod web-server
kubectl describe pod web-server | grep "Liveness\|Readiness\|Startup"
```
7. Retrieve the metrics of the Pod (e.g., CPU and memory) from the metrics server.
``` sh
kubectl top pod web-server
```
8. Create a Pod named `custom-cmd` with the image `busybox`. The container should run the command `top-analyzer` with the command-line flag `--all`.
```sh
kubectl run custom-cmd --image=busybox -o yaml --dry-run=client > custom-cmd.yaml
```
9. Inspect the status. How would you further troubleshoot the Pod to identify the root cause of the failure?
```sh
kubectl logs custom-cmd
```
